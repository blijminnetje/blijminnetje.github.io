# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Neural Networks

**Course:** Neural Networks & Deep Learning  
**Domain:** Financial Risk & Fraud Analytics

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using historical transaction data.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and class imbalance handling
- Neural network modeling
- Model performance evaluation using precision, recall, and ROC metrics

## Tools
Python, neural network frameworks, data visualization

## My Role
Built and evaluated machine learning models, analyzed fraud detection performance, and documented results in a technical report.

## Outcome
Demonstrated the effectiveness of neural networks in identifying high-risk transactions within highly imbalanced datasets.
